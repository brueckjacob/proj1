CPET437 Project 1

General Information:
    This project aims to introduce common fundamental practices of 3d computer vision using opencv and python. We are to calibrate a camera, set up a real world scene using april tags and measure real world objects.

Step 1:
    Open an anaconda command prompt tab and navigate to the CPET347_Project1 folder.

Step 2:
    Make sure you have python, opencv, and numpy installed. Type 'pip install opencv-python opencv-contrib-python' and 'pip install numpy==2.2.0' in the command window to install.

Step 3:
    Run 'python frameCapture.py' to take 15-20 pictures of your 10x7 chessboard using your external webcam.

Step 4:
    Run 'python proj1.py' to run the camera calibration, fix distortion, read april tags and RMSE functions.

Step 5:
    Set up your 4 printed 17.2 cm April Tags in a 2x2 square with the centers being 25 cm apart.

Step 6:
    Point your webcam at the April Tags to get the values and place an object of known measurements in the scene. Click on both sides of the object to get the measurement for it.
